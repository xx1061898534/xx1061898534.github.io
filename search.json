Whereas, a solid will deform only by a finite fixed amount.\nThe categories of the study of fluid\n\nfluid statics is the study of fluids at rest.  \nfluid kinematics is the study of fluids in motion just foucs on velocity vector()and acceleration vector().  \nfluid dynamics is the study of fluids in motion by force.\nhydro-dynamics is the study of fluid dynamisc when the fluid is ideal fluids(incompressible and frictionless).\nhydraulics is the study of liquid flows in pipes and open channels\ngas dynamics is the study of fluids that undergo significant density changes,such as the flow of gases through nozzles at high speed.\naerodynamics is the study of the flow of gases(especially air) over bodies such as aircraft,rockets, and automobiles at high or low speed.\n\n\nmultiphase flows is the study of flows that liquids and gases coexist.ðŸ’¬The materials which are solid-like when applied shear stress are small and fluid-like when aoolied shear stresses are high is the types of hybrid materials. The study of these materials is called rheology, which is often considered to be a field separate from fluid mechanics\n\nBasic Concepts of Fluid Flow","categories":["Fliud Mechanics and Vector Field for Engineering"],"tags":["math","engineering","MTH227"]},{"title":"Mathematical Review in Signal and Systems","url":"/2023/09/18/Mathematical-Review-in-Signal-and-Systems/","content":"FundamentalsTrigonometryExpontial and logarithmic identitiesCalculusDerivatives and integralSummation formulasOthogonality","categories":["Continuous and Discrete Time Signals and System"],"tags":["math","engineering","CAN207"]},{"title":"MTH227 Assignments1 and  solutions","url":"/2023/09/20/MTH227-Assignments1-and-solutions/","content":"Dimensions/Units1.1a)      \nFrom the question, we knowWe transfer the equation in standard  units\n\n1.2\nDensity1.3\nCompressibility1.4\n1.5\nIdeal Gases1.6\n1.7\nViscosity1.8\n1.9\n1.10\nSurface Tension1.11 \n1.12\n","categories":["Fliud Mechanics and Vector Field for Engineering"],"tags":["math","engineering","MTH227","MTH227Assignments"]},{"title":"The Overall of the blog","url":"/2023/09/14/The-Overall-of-the-blog/","content":"","tags":["Overall"]}]
